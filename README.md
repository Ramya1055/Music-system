# Music system with c++

Developed a console-based music player application in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
principles, implementing features such as song management, premium content, and displaying song details
with polymorphism and inheritance.Developed classes such as Song, Playlist and MusicPlayer to handle features like adding ,deleting and playing
songs, and creating custom playlists.
 Applied OOPS concepts such as inheritance , polymorphism, encapsulation and abstraction to ensure modular
and reusable code.
Enhanced understanding of C++ programming and real-world applications of OOPS concepts.
